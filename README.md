# apPETite
Welcome! This GitHub repository is home to all the data and results of the computational portion of UIUC iGEM's project. This is also where our final pipeline is located, containing the development of our machine learning model to generate novel PETase sequences.

## Sequence outputs
This folder contains the outputs of our pipeline.

## PD_RNN_V2_newseq.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook contains the final pipeline for our model.

## sequences-final.txt
This file contains the set of sequences we used to train our machine learning model.
